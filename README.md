i like numbers.

i build **machine learning models**,  
analyze **data**,  
and use **C++ / Qt** to turn ideas into something you can actually click.

i’m endlessly curious — about how things work, why they fail,  
and how to make them just a little bit better next time.  

always **learning**. always **building**. sometimes lost.
